# E-Commerce Backend
A scalable E-commerce Backend System built with Django, PostgreSQL, and JWT Authentication.
This project simulates a real-world backend engineering environment, focusing on database design, API development, performance optimization, and secure authentication.


## Project Overview
This backend manages products, categories, and users** for an e-commerce platform.
It includes CRUD APIs, filtering, sorting, pagination, and JWT authentication, with APIs documented via Swagger/Postman.


## Features
1. User Authentication
Register, login, JWT-based authentication.
Secure password hashing.

2. Product & Category Management
CRUD APIs for products and categories.
Filtering (by category), sorting (by price), and pagination.

3. API Doumentation
Swagger UI or Postman collection for API testing.

4. Database Optimization
PostgreSQL schema with indexes for faster queries.
Efficient queryset usage with select_related and prefetch_related.

5. Deployment
Dockerized for easy deployment.
Supports deployment on Railway with environment variables.


## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
* Backend Framework: Django REST Framework
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Authentication: JWT (djangorestframework-simplejwt)
* Documentation: Swagger / drf-yasg or Postman
* Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose
* Deployment: Railway.

## Setup & Installation

# Local Set up.
1. Clone repository
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <project-folder>

2. Create virtual environment & install dependencies
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure environment variables
    export DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>
    export SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>

4. Run migrations
    python manage.py migrate

5. Start server
    python manage.py runserver


# Railway Deployment
Push your code to Railway, which automatically builds the Docker image.
Set the required environment variables in Railwayâ€™s settings (DATABASE_URL,REDIS_URL, SECRET_KEY).
Railway handles container orchestration and deployment automatically.


## API Endpoints
1.  Authentication
* `POST /api/auth/register/` â†’ Register new user
* `POST /api/auth/login/` â†’ Login and get JWT

2. Products
* `GET /api/products/` â†’ List products (supports filtering, sorting, pagination)
* `POST /api/products/` â†’ Create product (Admin only)
* `GET /api/products/{id}/` â†’ Get single product
* `PUT /api/products/{id}/` â†’ Update product
* `DELETE /api/products/{id}/` â†’ Delete product

3. Categories

* `GET /api/categories/` â†’ List categories
* `POST /api/categories/` â†’ Create category
* `GET /api/categories/{id}/` â†’ Get category
* `PUT /api/categories/{id}/` â†’ Update category
* `DELETE /api/categories/{id}/` â†’ Delete category

4. Authentication

This project uses JWT Authentication:

* Obtain access and refresh tokens via `/api/auth/login/`.
* Include access token in request headers:

Authorization: Bearer <access_token>


## ðŸ“‘ API Documentation

Swagger UI available at:
/swagger/


## Performance Optimization

* Added indexes on `category_id` and `price` fields.
* Used queryset prefetch/select_related to minimize queries.
* Implemented paginated responses for large datasets.


## Future Improvements
* Add payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal).
