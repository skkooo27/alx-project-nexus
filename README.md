# ALX Project Nexus

## Overview
This repository serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings from the ALX ProDev Backend Engineering Program. The program equipped me with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience in backend engineering. I explored advanced Python, databases,APIs and Devops while also applying backend best practices in security, testing, and performance optimization.

## Key Technologies Covered
1. Python(advanced features: generators, decorators, async programming)
2. Django & Django REST Framework.
3. GraphQL.
4. Docker & Kubernetes.
5. CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
6. Redis.
7. RabbitMQ.

## Important Backend Development Concepts
1. Database & Backend Foundations
-Project planning and database design
-Advanced SQL querying
-Unit and integration testing with pytest.

2. DevOps & Microservices
-advanced shell commands and DevOps introduction
-CI/CD pipelines for automation and deployment
-Containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes
-Microservices architecture design and implementation

3. Security & Performance Optimization

- Security best practices.
- Authentication and Authorization: JWT, OAuth, Django auth system
- Performance optimization through caching.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

- Debugging distributed systems: Solved by implementing structured logging and tracing across microservices.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Write tests early to ensure stability.
- Security is a continuous process, not a one-time setup.
- Automating deployments with CI/CD reduces errors and saves time.
- Backend systems should prioritize scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
